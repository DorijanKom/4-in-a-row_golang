# **Connect Four**

Connect Four, also famously known by the name Four in a Row among other names, is a world-famous board game, in which the goal of the game is to, as the name of the game implies, connect four of the same-colored circles in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally (either left-leaning or right-leaning). Many games have had their virtual adaptations and so has this game as well.

As a part of our Programming Languages course, we were tasked with recreating this classic board game into a playable game on our computers. As an added description, we have been assigned to make it using the Go programming language. Another thing to mention is that the game was made using the VS Code IDE.
